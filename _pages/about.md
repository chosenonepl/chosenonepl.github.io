Hi, my name Tomasz an Information and Cyber Security Professional involved in both “offensive” (e.g. Pentest, Red Teaming) and “defensive” (e.g. Incident Response, Security Monitoring) security operations. My passion for information technology and security extends beyond my employment, and as such there’s a few reasons that this blog exists, in short I wanted:

	• A place to consolidate and publish some ‘Capture The Flag’ achievements and my thought process which lead to these achievements.
	• A place to publish some of my public research, thoughts, and learning outcomes to help others improve themselves and their processes relating to information and cyber security.
	• To lower the barrier of entry for upcoming security professionals who are interested in breaking into the field but don’t know how.
  
I’m always interested in hearing from people with similar professional interests, my former colleagues, and people who share my passions so fell free to reach out to me if you’d like to connect.
